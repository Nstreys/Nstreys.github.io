          <p><span>At first there were not even local publishers, and games were sold in natural markets, which, as it was in Warsaw, occupied football stadiums and other cultural buildings. The fact that such copyright was not even known, and pirated games had no alternative (it was about music with films). All the major studios that have now arisen in the late 1990s and beyond: Illusion Softworks (1997), CD Project Red (2002), Bohemia Interactive Studio (1999), People Can Fly (2002), etc. After all, to develop for consoles, you had to pay tens of thousands of platform-holders for a license and tools.</span></p><p><span>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had great scientific and technical capabilities and its own semiconductor industry. Also, scientific centers were preserved in Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and other republics. By 1991, at least a hundred home PC models were produced in the CIS. Although for the most part they were clones of Western models, such as the Spectrum, but they were also developed. Along with the collapse of the economy, almost all high-tech production ordered to live long, and the majority of the population had other concerns. Old institutions collapsed, and no one was in a hurry to create new ones. This is not to mention the economic tailspin that the country has fallen into since 1991.</span></p><p><span>The decline in production, unemployment and poverty clearly did not contribute to the formation of the consumer market. Only a few development teams were involved in the creation of relatively high-quality games. Accordingly, the game could also be counted on the fingers. But despite the above began to emerge major publishers/developers like &quot;Buki&quot; (1993), famous for the quests &quot;Petka and Vasily Ivanovich save the galaxy&quot; (1998). Just then, a lot of pirate firms involved in the localization of Western games grew, and in the 2000s they almost all legalized.</span></p>

          <p><span>The heyday of the industry throughout Eastern Europe came in the early 2000s, when the time was irretrievably gone, allowing the creation of the AAA class game by a team of 10 people in a year. Serious projects required no less serious financing, and the money that investors had invested under a certain level of profitability: 100 rubles invested, it was necessary to provide 125 rubles of profit. There were not many people who wanted to take such risks in the countries where the elements of piracy were raging.</span></p>

          <p><span>And yet large projects came out and even received foreign funding. Even branches of Western studios were opened, or studios are close to them affiliates, like Saber Interactive. Even the famous GSC Game World was developing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with the support of TH. It just so happened that most of the games were created in Russia and Ukraine. Although the first grew on localizations, and the second more on their own developments. &quot;Anabiosis: A Dream of Reason&quot; (2008) was developed by the Ukrainian company Action Forms. And other campaigns.</span></p>
